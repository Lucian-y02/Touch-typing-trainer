Just remember that "words of kindness" go a long way. Everyone enjoys receiving words of kindness, since all people are facing challenges in some way and those words offer confidence and assurance. In tough times, kindness is a lit candle in darkness.
Encourage kids to learn music. Music is more than just memorizing songs. Music is a spiritual journey that shows rhythm, harmony and much more. Music will carry kids far in their lives; it will help them through difficult times and inspire others.
Encourage kids to read. Today with all the technology we have, our minds get fragmented. To refocus, encourage your kids and even their friends to read a good book. Offer to buy them a book they want to read. There is nothing like a great book.
Smile. This does not mean you are a freak or mentally disturbed. Is there anything wrong with being happy and sharing that happiness? If that is true, then our society is truly in trouble. A smile radiates good energy. Smiling is totally natural too.
